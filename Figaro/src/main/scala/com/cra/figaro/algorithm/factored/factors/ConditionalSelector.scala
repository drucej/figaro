 * ConditionalSelector Factor. A conditional selector factor is associated chain elements and represents the relationship
 * between parent elements and outcome elements. It is a special form of sparse factor where the default element is not 
 * 0 but 1 (don't care) which is the most frequent in this type of factor.
