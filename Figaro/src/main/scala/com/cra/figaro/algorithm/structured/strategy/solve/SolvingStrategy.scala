 * A solving strategy solves an inference problem after a series of refinements have been made. This can involve solving
 * subproblems and collecting their factors, but this class does not account for subproblems by default. Executing the
 * strategy then eliminates variables that do not belong in the solution.
 *
 * By default, solving strategies do not use parameterized factors, but subclasses can override this.
